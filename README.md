# Efficient Lung Disease Classification Using AttentiveLightNet  
### A Novel Lightweight CNN with Attention and Adaptive Dropout  

This repository contains the implementation of **AttentiveLightNet**, a novel deep learning model designed for highly efficient and accurate binary classification of lung diseases (**Normal vs. Pneumonia**) from chest X-ray images.  

The project emphasizes balancing high diagnostic performance with minimal computational overhead, making the model suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or edge devices in clinics.
